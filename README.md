# 3. Generating and Customizing Your Application

## 3.1. Generating the Core Application

1. **Use the Web-Based Project Generator:**  
   - In the dashboard, locate “Project Generator” or “Create New Project.”  
   - When prompted for a template, specify:
     ```
     Use a blank application template for dashboard layouts.
     ```
2. **Configure Basic Settings:**  
   - Review the generated configuration file via the built-in file explorer.  
   - Update application title, description, time zone, and default date formats as needed.

## 3.2. Customizing and Enhancing Widgets

### 3.2A. Revamping Existing Widgets

1. **Task List Widget Customization:**  
   - Navigate to the “Widgets” section and open the “Task List” widget by clicking its “Edit” (pencil) icon.
   - Update the prompt for this widget:
     ```
     Modify the Task List Widget to display tasks for the selected day in a vertical list. Each task card should include a checkbox for completion, a bold task title, the scheduled time, and an edit icon. Use subtle color-coding for different priority levels.
     ```
   - Save the changes.

### 3.2B. Adding Advanced, Exciting Widgets

To make your app more inspiring and engaging, add the following advanced widgets:

1. **Motivational Quote Widget:**  
   - In the Widgets section, click “Add New Widget.”
   - **Widget Name:**  
     ```
     Motivational Quote
     ```
   - **Widget Description/Prompt:**  
     ```
     Create a widget that displays a daily motivational quote. The quote should update each day by calling an AI-powered text generation service. Include options to style the text (e.g., bold, italic) and change the background color dynamically.
     ```
   - Use the built-in editor to adjust fonts, colors, and animations (for example, fade in the new quote at the start of each day).  
   - Save your widget.

2. **Motivational Image Widget:**  
   - Again, click “Add New Widget.”
   - **Widget Name:**  
     ```
     Motivational Image
     ```
   - **Widget Description/Prompt:**  
     ```
     Create a widget that displays an inspirational image that matches the theme of the day. The image should be generated via an AI-powered image generation service, with a prompt such as "Generate an inspiring landscape that evokes a sense of achievement and positivity."
     ```
   - Use advanced settings (e.g., adjust the Temperature and Top P parameters for creative outputs).  
   - Save your widget.

3. **Inspiration Board Widget (Optional):**  
   - Click “Add New Widget” to further enhance your app.
   - **Widget Name:**  
     ```
     Inspiration Board
     ```
   - **Widget Description/Prompt:**  
     ```
     Create an inspiration board that aggregates a motivational quote, a matching image, and a short tip of the day. Use @ referencing to pull in the outputs from the Motivational Quote and Motivational Image widgets, and add an additional text element with a daily tip.
     ```
   - Arrange the content so that the board looks like a mini dashboard of inspiration.  
   - Save the widget.

4. **Quick Add Task Widget:**  
   - Create a new widget named “Quick Add Task” if not already added.
   - **Widget Description/Prompt:**  
     ```
     Create a widget that allows users to quickly add a new task. Include an input field for the task title, an optional time picker, a text area for notes, and a prominent submit button. Validate that the task title is not empty, clear inputs upon submission, and refresh the Task List widget.
     ```
   - Save and integrate with your task management backend.

### 3.2C. Integrating Widgets into Your Layout

1. **Edit the Main Layout:**  
   - Open the layout editor from the dashboard.
   - Arrange your widgets in a visually engaging manner:
     - **Header:** Include the application title and a daily motivational tagline.
     - **Left Panel:** Place the Calendar Widget.
     - **Central Panel:** Position the Task List widget.
     - **Right Panel (or floating element):** Add the Inspiration Board widget.
     - **Footer or Header:** Integrate the Motivational Quote and Motivational Image widgets so they remain visible and update daily.
     - **Floating Widget:** Ensure the Quick Add Task widget is easily accessible.
   - Use drag-and-drop functionality to reposition widgets, and use the advanced settings to resize and style them for a cohesive look.
